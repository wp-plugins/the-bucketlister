Holy crap! You're going to die! Best make a list...

== Description ==

Feel immortal? Feel like you've got plenty of time to make your dreams come true? Not worried about death? The future?

The Bucketlister is for you!

The Bucketlister is all about making a list of all the things that you want to do before you die and putting time limits on them so you can see, day by day, your life ticking away! Fun for all the family!

Write down your dreams, give yourself a deadline then GO AND MAKE THEM HAPPEN!

If this plugin makes your dreams come true (hey, it could happen), then let me know! 

I always believed WordPress plugins could change people's lives.

== Installation ==

1. Your PHP needs to have the relatively new DateTime class installed. If you don't know whether or not it does, try the plugin out anyway. It'll check for you and won't install anything if it can't find it.
1. Upload the `bucketlister` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Go to the `Settings` panel, and somewhere in there should be an item called `Bucketlister`
1. Make some death lists!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't want to die! =

I know, I know. If I could develop a WordPress plugin that could stave off death, I would (and you'd be the first to get it). Unfortunately, I can't.

Instead, take a deep breath, then start making a list of all the cool things that you want to do before you die. Trust me, it'll make you feel better*.
